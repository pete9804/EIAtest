If you want to build something you need to take into account the probable environmental impact of your scheme. There is all sorts of legislation and regulation governing what you can and cannot do, covering diverse topics like ecology, heritage, noise, air quality and so on. Bur binding all this together is the process of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which itself is governed by legislation, regulation, and guidance. 

EIA is a staged process:

 * First is **screening** - do you need to do a full EIA in the first place? Some types of development _always_ need an EIA [[example]]; some types _never_ need an EIA [[example]]. Most types of development _may_ need an EIA, depending on factors like their size and likely environmental impact [[example]]
 * Next comes **scoping** - what are the probable significant impacts of the scheme? Only those aspects that are likely to entail "significant" (there's that word again) effects should be investigated fully. A development in an urban area might not have any impact on protected species, but if there are residents next door to the site then they may be really affected by noise and dust nuisance during construction. Conversely, a site in a rural area may affect local wildlife but if there are no neighbours, there is not likely to be any problems with noise disturbing people
 * Next comes the **Environmental Statement** (ES) itself. This reports the in-depth studies and assessments that have been carried out on the significant aspects identified during scoping. It then looks at what mitigation is required to minimise adverse environmental effects and maximise any beneficial ones

The EIA process is paid for by and undertaken on behalf of the developer as part of applying for planning permission. The ES will never conclude "this scheme is so bad you can't build it", that is for the planning authority to determine. In practice what happens is that either a scheme is dropped at an early stage if it becomes obvious that an EIA will identify serious problems for which the required mitigation would make the scheme unviable; or the planning authority will insist on planning conditions to mitigate environmental damage that make the scheme unviable.

Oxford Brookes University runs a two-day workshop on screening, scoping, and ES review. This takes you through the EIA process by using real-world examples to consider what the important factors are at each stage.

###Screening
Divided in to teams, we were all given a screening report that had been submitted by a developer to the local authority to request a _screening opinion_. A screening opinion is:

> a  written statement of the opinion of the relevant planning
authority as to whether development is EIA development (EIA Regulations 2011)

The proposed development entailed the installation of one "medium sized" wind turbine, with a hub height of 34 m and a maximum tip height of 51 m in Colstoun, East Lothian.

My first instinct was that the scheme _would_ require an EIA - it's fairly intrinsic to wind turbines that they be highly visible in the landscape. Unsurprisingly, the developer felt otherwise:

> The Proposed Development comprises only one medium sized wind turbine which has been sited in a location designed to have minimal impacts on the neighbouring social, cultural and ecological environment.

Our team also came to this conclusion, the location was fairly isolated and whilst there were going to be some receptors that would be affected we felt that this wouldn't be "significant".

After each team had come to their conclusion we presented our findings to the other groups. Every other team said that more information was needed, which is a legitimate response from the planning authority if it feels that they have not been presented with enough information to make a decision, but when pressed thought that no EIA was needed. We were bold and said that _no_, it didn't need an EIA. We felt that some risks we had identified could be adequately managed, and that whilst we would have liked further information we didn't think that it would actually have changed our minds.

As it turns out we were all wrong! The actual screening opinion from the planning authority was that it did require EIA. Still, it was a borderline scheme - which was why it was used in the workshop - and as Martin Broderick the course convenor said often, it's all subjective, although you need to justify your opinion.

###Scoping
The 2011 EIA Regulations state that:
> person who is minded to make an EIA application may ask the relevant planning authority to state in writing their opinion as to the information to be provided in the environmental statement (a “scoping opinion”). 

For scoping, we were given the front end of a real scoping report for the construction of an underground gas pipeline. The bulk of the report had been omitted, and our task was to decide what we thought could be scoped out.

From the report:
> The proposal is for a gas pipeline, connecting the National Transmission System to the site of the proposed [power station]. It is proposed that the pipeline will be approximately 800mm in diameter and buried for its entire length [28 to 30 km]. The minimum nominal depth of cover is expected to be 1.2m in agricultural land. The AGI [Above Ground Installation] will comprise a fenced compound containing above ground equipment, such as a pig launcher.

We had been advised to 'have some balls' when it came to scoping topics out, so we approached the task looking for reasons to leave things out rather than to include them. My own experience has been that Environmental Statements always end up longer than you really want them, so I'm all for cutting out as much as possible. I'm also a bit thrown by the wording of the regulations - in Schedule 4 ("Information for inclusion in Environmental Statements"), Part 2 lists the minimum information required and includes the statement:

> The data required to identify and assess the _main_ effects which the development is likely to have on the environment.

To me, _main_ and _significant_ are very different things; an effect could be considered significant without being one of the "main" effects of a scheme. However in searching the Regulations for "main" it doesn't seem to come up anywhere else, the term used is always "significant" so I guess that one line is a bit of an anomaly.

As we thought more about the construction of the scheme it became clear that actually there wasn't a whole lot we could scope out. However as it was an underground pipeline we managed to scope out more topics for the operational phase. We were slightly hampered by not having access to the background information, all we had was the proposed development, but that was enough to make some reasonable conclusions. Broadly, all the teams had similar opinions on this, althoug again I think our team was a bit more gung ho in scoping stuff out.

###Environmental Statement
I've decided to break this post up, so the final day's activities - reviewing an Environmental Statement, will be coming soon!d
